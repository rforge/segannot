TODO

SegAnnotBases should return with an error if a breakpoint region is
specified where there is no breakpoint that would show up on the
plot. Currently, we assume that the user supplies valid breakpoint
regions.

PrunedDP should return a list of segments (min, max mean) and
breakpoints (min, mid, max) like SegAnnotBases.
